# Maps in Go

Maps are key–value data structures (similar to objects in JavaScript and dictionaries in Python).

Maps are **reference-like types**. This means the map header is stored at one memory address, while the underlying data is stored at another. When you pass a map to a function, changes made inside the function affect the original map.

## Syntax

### Map literal

```go
names := map[keyType]valueType{
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2,
}
```

### Using `make`

```go
var names map[keyType]valueType
names = make(map[keyType]valueType)

names[key] = value
```

⚠️ A map has a **nil zero value**. In the second approach, the map must be initialized with `make` before assigning values, otherwise the program will panic.

---

## Accessing and Setting Values

You cannot access map values using dot notation:

```go
// ❌ Invalid
names.id1 = "jack"
```

Keys are values, not fields. You must use bracket notation:

```go
// ✅ Valid
names["id1"] = "jack"
```

---

## Delete

You can delete a key and its value using the built-in `delete` function:

```go
delete(names, key)
```

If the key does not exist, `delete` does nothing (no error).

---

## Iterating Over a Map

```go
for key, value := range names {
    // use key and value
}
```

Iteration order in maps is **not guaranteed** and may change between runs.

# Map vs Struct

### Type constraints

* In a **map**, all keys must be of the same type, and all values must be of the same type.
* In a **struct**, fields (attributes) are predefined and each field can have a different type.

### Mutability

* Maps can be empty and can grow or shrink dynamically.
* Structs always have all fields defined, each initialized with its zero value.

### Deletion

* You can delete keys from a map.
* You cannot delete fields from a struct.

### Iteration

* Maps can be iterated over using `range`.
* Struct fields cannot be iterated over directly without reflection.

### Memory semantics

* Maps are **reference types**.
* Structs are **value types** (copies are made on assignment, unless passed by pointer).

### When to use each

* Use a **map** when you have related data of the **same type** and dynamic keys.
* Use a **struct** when you have related data of **different types** with a fixed schema.

Maps are flexible and scalable for large or unknown sets of keys, while structs are strict and ideal for well-defined data models.
